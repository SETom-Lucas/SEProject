## After the course meeting and presentation 

Ater the presentation given to V.MÃ¼ller and the rest of the class, and taking into consideration the feedback from both, we have decided to abandon the "Getting to know the staff through music website" project, in favor of another idea : a guess who style game. The reason for this shif in perspective is due to the risk of failure of the 1st plan being so high (i.e that teachers wouldn't respond to our questionaire). 

## Defining the parameters of the project 

while discussing the details of the project we realised that we both had vastly different ideas of what the project would entail. Due to this we decided to research some of the ideas proposed today, decide if they were feasible and interesting, and to meet tomorrow to finalise our vision of the end product.

# Meeting Report 6

*Date : 03.05.22 time : 10:00 - 11:00*

## Content
As mentioned in the previous meeting report, my partner and I talk a lot informally over Discord. So this meeting is to discuss the progress we have made so far, and to plan for the next sprint. Last wednesday we had a presentation to present the result of the first sprint. Now with the feedback given to us by professor MÃ¼ller we can plan properly for the second sprint.

## Progress
Overall we worked on getting a working demo for the presentation, meaning that the main functionalities for the **Quiz** to be working are all in place. They just need to me tweaked and expanded on to make the game more enjoyable.

- We linked the back-end to the front-end, meaning a demo of the quiz is now playable in the app.
- We extended the question database to include 2 more questions
- Implemented an end screen that displays the score and allows the user to return to the main menu or to play the quizz again where the questions and answers will be randomised again.
- Implemented the ability to display images for the questions

## Sprint 2 goals

- Refine the overall experience and fix bugs, notably the *Double Click* bug we discovered recently.
- Add more questions to the quiz
- Implement a ***Hanged Man*** game

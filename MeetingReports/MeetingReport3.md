## Content : decisions on the project/defining the parameters of the project

We decided on a direction for the project: a *Swift* app with fun trivia quizzes regarding the FSTM. With the possible addition of future gamemodes (such as hangman, etc.) in accordance with an agile software development process, these ideas can be added at a later stage of development.

We chose *Swift* as a programming language because both of us have significant experience with the language, and it has enough resources online that we believe it will be an asset and not a detriment to our project.

## Content
In this meeting we will be recaping the advancements made during this sprint. Including the hangman and fixing the final few issues with the quiz. We will be preparing the presentation for the final sprint and making sure that our project functions as intended

## Progress

    Due to some personal issues we struggled to get all of the tasks we had set out to do in a comfortable amount of time. we did succeed in preforming most of the tasks we had set out to do before the end of the second sprint.

    - We increased the amount of questions in the database
    - created a function for the hangman game
    - created an interface for the hangman game 
    - connected the front-end and back-end to make the two function together properly

    We still need to flesh out some of the details but globaly our project meets the criteria we wanted it to meet.
